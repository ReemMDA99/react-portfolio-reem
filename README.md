# React Portfolio by Reem
#### Challenge 20

Create a portfolio using react framework.

## Description

React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template.

 SPAs interact with the browser by dynamically rewriting the current webpage with new data from the web server, instead of requiring the browser to load entirely new pages.

## Installation

- The user should clone the repository from GitHub
- Install `npx create-react-app <PROJECTNAME>`.
- Run `npm install` to ensure that your project is now running React version
- To run server, run `npm start`.

## Technologies Used

- React
- SPA
- JSX
- React DOM
- gh-pages
- Fontawesome
- Bootstrap
- Coolers
